# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    always_declare_return_types: true  # Enforces declaring return types for functions
    prefer_const_constructors: true    # Encourages the use of constant constructors
    prefer_final_locals: true          # Prefer using final for local variables if they are not reassigned
    avoid_print: true                  # Discourages using print statements in the code
    type_init_formals: true            # Enforces type annotations for constructor initialization formals
    prefer_single_quotes: true         # Prefer using single quotes instead of double quotes for strings
